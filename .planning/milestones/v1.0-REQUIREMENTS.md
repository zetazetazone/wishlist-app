## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Voice/video chat | Massive scope increase, not needed for gift coordination |
| AI gift suggestions | Scope creep, focus on coordination first |
| Email/SMS notifications | Push + in-app sufficient for mobile-first app |
| Location-based reminders | Privacy concerns, requires continuous tracking |
| Payment splitting in-app | Gift Leader tracks contributions manually |
| Complex calendar features | Stay birthday-focused, don't rebuild Google Calendar |
