  <name>Task 1: Create reminder scheduling migration</name>
  <files>supabase/migrations/20260202000007_reminder_scheduling.sql</files>
  <action>
Create a comprehensive SQL migration with:

1. **Add timezone column to users table:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS timezone TEXT DEFAULT 'UTC';
   ```

2. **Create reminder_sent tracking table:**
   - celebration_id (UUID, FK to celebrations)
   - user_id (UUID, FK to users)
   - reminder_type (TEXT, CHECK IN: '4w', '2w', '1w', 'day_of', 'happy_birthday', 'gift_leader_initial', 'gift_leader_1w')
   - sent_at (TIMESTAMPTZ, DEFAULT NOW())
   - UNIQUE constraint on (celebration_id, user_id, reminder_type)
   - RLS policy: users can view their own sent reminders

3. **Create user_group_preferences table for muting:**
   - user_id (UUID, FK to users)
   - group_id (UUID, FK to groups)
   - mute_reminders (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT FALSE)
   - PRIMARY KEY (user_id, group_id)
   - RLS policy: users can manage their own preferences

4. **Create process_birthday_reminders() function:**
   - Runs every 15 minutes
   - Finds users where local time is 9:00 AM (within 15-min window using AT TIME ZONE)
   - For each celebration in 28-day window:
     - Calculate days_until from event_date
     - Determine reminder_type: 28 days = '4w', 14 = '2w', 7 = '1w', 0 = 'day_of'
     - Skip if reminder already in reminder_sent
     - Skip if user has muted the group
     - **Celebrant exclusion:** Skip countdown reminders (4w/2w/1w) for celebrant
     - Celebrant DOES get 'happy_birthday' on day-of

   **BATCHING SCOPE (IMPORTANT - per-group only):**
   - Batching happens ONLY within a single group
   - Multiple birthdays in the SAME group on the same day = ONE batched notification
   - Multiple birthdays across DIFFERENT groups on the same day = SEPARATE notifications (one per group)
   - Example: Alice and Bob have birthdays on same day in Group A → one notification: "2 birthdays in Group A!"
   - Example: Alice (Group A) and Carol (Group B) have birthdays on same day → TWO separate notifications
   - This respects the user decision: "Multi-group overlap: Separate reminders per group (no deduplication)"

   **NEW MEMBER CATCH-UP LOGIC:**
   - Detect new group members by checking group_members.created_at
   - For users who joined a group AFTER a celebration's 28-day window started:
     - Determine which reminder types they missed based on their join date
     - Example: User joins 10 days before birthday → missed '4w' and '2w', should get '1w' catch-up
     - Send catch-up reminders in sequence during their 9:00 AM window
     - Mark each catch-up as sent in reminder_sent to prevent duplicates
   - Catch-up query logic:
     ```sql
     -- Find celebrations where user joined after some reminders were due
     WHERE gm.created_at > (c.event_date - INTERVAL '28 days')
       AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM reminder_sent rs
         WHERE rs.celebration_id = c.id
           AND rs.user_id = gm.user_id
           AND rs.reminder_type = [calculated_type]
       )
     ```
   - Calculate which reminder would be "current" based on days_until at join time
   - Send the NEXT appropriate reminder (e.g., joined at 10 days → send '1w' when they hit 7 days)

   **GIFT LEADER 1-WEEK NUDGE:**
   - When days_until = 7 AND user = celebration.gift_leader_id:
     - Send special 'gift_leader_1w' reminder (in addition to regular '1w' if applicable)
     - Title: "1 week left — have you collected contributions?"
     - Body: "{celebrant_name}'s birthday is in 7 days. ${contributed} of ${goal} collected from {contributor_count} people."
     - Include: celebration_id, group_id, contribution progress, contributor names/count
     - Skip if 'gift_leader_1w' already in reminder_sent for this celebration+user

   - Insert into user_notifications with data for deep linking:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "birthday_reminder",
       "screen": "celebration",
       "celebration_id": "uuid",
       "group_id": "uuid",
       "avatar_url": "url"
     }
     ```
   - Include contribution progress in body: "$45 of $60 goal"
   - Record in reminder_sent with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
   - Use SECURITY DEFINER for cross-table access

5. **Schedule pg_cron job:**
   - Remove existing job if exists (idempotent)
   - Schedule: '*/15 * * * *' (every 15 minutes)
   - Call: SELECT public.process_birthday_reminders();

**Notification content patterns:**
- 4w: "{name}'s birthday in 4 weeks!"
- 2w: "{name}'s birthday in 2 weeks! ${contributed} of ${goal} collected."
- 1w: "1 week until {name}'s birthday! ${contributed} of ${goal} collected."
- day_of (non-celebrant): "It's {name}'s birthday today! Tap to celebrate."
- happy_birthday (celebrant): "Happy Birthday! Your group is celebrating you today."
- gift_leader_1w: "1 week left — have you collected contributions?" (Gift Leader only)

**Batched notification (per-group only):**
- Title: "{count} birthdays in {group_name} in {time}!"
- Body: "{names} all have birthdays on {date}. Tap to coordinate."

**Key implementation details:**
- Use PostgreSQL AT TIME ZONE for DST-safe timezone conversion
- 15-min window: EXTRACT(HOUR) = 9 AND EXTRACT(MINUTE) < 15
- Join user_group_preferences to filter muted groups
- Join celebrations with status IN ('upcoming', 'active')
- Join celebration_contributions for progress totals
- Join group_members with created_at for catch-up detection

1. Migration file exists
2. Run `npx supabase db push` or apply manually
3. Verify tables: SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name IN ('reminder_sent', 'user_group_preferences');
4. Verify function: SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'process_birthday_reminders';
5. Verify cron job: SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'process-birthday-reminders';
6. Test function manually: SELECT public.process_birthday_reminders();
7. Test new member catch-up: Add user to group mid-window, verify they get appropriate reminder
8. Test Gift Leader 1w: Set user as gift_leader_id, advance to 7 days, verify special nudge

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add automatic timezone detection to push notifications hook</name>
  <files>hooks/usePushNotifications.ts</files>
  <action>
Modify the existing usePushNotifications hook to automatically detect and save the user's timezone:

1. After successful push token registration, detect user's timezone:
   ```typescript
   const timezone = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone;
   ```

2. Save timezone to users table (alongside token save or separately):
   ```typescript
   await supabase
     .from('users')
     .update({ timezone })
     .eq('id', session.user.id);
   ```

3. Update timezone on every app open (not just first registration) to catch:
   - Users who travel
   - DST changes affecting timezone name

4. Add error handling - timezone save failure should NOT block push registration

**Integration point:** This runs when the hook initializes and the user is authenticated.

**Rationale:** Automatic detection respects user privacy (no manual input required) while ensuring accurate local time delivery for notifications.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Open app in Expo dev build
2. Check Supabase: SELECT timezone FROM users WHERE id = 'your-user-id';
3. Timezone should match device setting (e.g., 'America/New_York')
4. Push notifications still work after change
  </verify>
  <done>
- usePushNotifications hook detects timezone using Intl.DateTimeFormat
- Timezone is saved to users.timezone on app open
- No regression in push token registration
  </done>
</task>

## Plan Verification

1. **Reminder scheduling works:**
   - Create test celebration 7 days from now
   - Set user timezone to current timezone
   - Manually run: `SELECT public.process_birthday_reminders();`
   - Check user_notifications for reminder
   - Check reminder_sent for tracking record

2. **Celebrant exclusion works:**
   - As celebrant, should NOT see 4w/2w/1w reminders in user_notifications
   - AS celebrant, SHOULD see 'happy_birthday' on day-of

3. **Muting works:**
   - Insert into user_group_preferences with mute_reminders = true
   - Run reminder function
   - No notification created for that group

4. **Batching works (per-group scope):**
   - Create 2 celebrations on same day IN SAME GROUP
   - Run reminder function
   - Should see single batched notification for that group
   - Create celebration on same day IN DIFFERENT GROUP
   - Run reminder function
   - Should see SEPARATE notification for second group

5. **New member catch-up works:**
   - Create celebration starting 28-day window
   - Add new user to group when 10 days remain
   - Run reminder function at 7 days
   - New user should receive '1w' reminder (caught up)
   - Check reminder_sent shows appropriate tracking

6. **Gift Leader 1-week nudge works:**
   - Create celebration with gift_leader_id set
   - At 7 days remaining, run reminder function
   - Gift Leader should receive 'gift_leader_1w' with collection progress
   - Check reminder_sent shows 'gift_leader_1w' recorded

7. **Timezone detection works:**
   - Open app
   - Check users.timezone is populated
