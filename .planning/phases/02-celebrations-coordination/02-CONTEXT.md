# Phase 2: Celebrations & Coordination - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Coordinate group gifts through automatic Gift Leader assignment (based on birthday order) and secret chat rooms where everyone except the celebrant can plan together. Includes contribution tracking so the group knows who's contributing what.

## Implementation Decisions

### Contribution Tracking
- **Visibility:** Everyone except the celebrant can see who contributed what amount
- **Timing:** Contributions can be logged anytime during planning, amounts can be updated freely
- **Scope:** Contributions are per-celebration (general pot), not tied to specific wishlist items
- **Display:** Running total progress bar showing total contributed vs target (if one is set)

### Claude's Discretion
- Gift Leader assignment algorithm (birthday rotation logic)
- Gift Leader UI/responsibilities display
- Celebration lifecycle states and timing
- Chat UI layout and message types
- How users navigate to/find celebration chats
- Target amount setting (optional feature within contribution tracking)
