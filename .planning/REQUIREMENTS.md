## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Mystery Box purchasing | v1.1 adds placeholder only, actual purchasing deferred |
| Birthday editing | Cascades to celebrations, requires careful design |
| Custom Mystery Box tiers | Fixed €25/€50/€100 tiers for v1.1 |
| AI gift suggestions | Scope creep, focus on coordination |
| Multiple favorites per group | One favorite per group is sufficient signal |
